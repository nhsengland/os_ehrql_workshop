## About the OpenSAFELY platform

The OpenSAFELY platform is a secure analytics framework for electronic health records research in the NHS.

Instead of requesting access for slices of patient data and transporting them elsewhere for analysis,
the platform supports developing analytics against dummy data
and then running against the real data *within the same infrastructure that the real data is stored*.
